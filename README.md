# SilexBlog

This project is a simple API designed to provide basic blog service : 
  - list of articles
  - display one article for the user to read
  - a back-office to create, update or delete articles.

The purpose of this is for me to get used to GitHub as well as testing the micro-framework Silex. 
As a beginning Symfony2 developper it was interesting to experiment with this micro-framework for future small APIs, 
in which performance is extremely important.

You can see in my GitHub another similar project I did at the same time to try the micro-framework Lumen (by Laravel). 
The history of Commits shows that even though the final result is very similar with both frameworks, the path was not the same.
